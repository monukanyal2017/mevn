Steps
1- Make node js app with api [you can use mysql/ mongodb +mongoose ,its your choice] but use express js framework because it has a biggest role in setting node js with angular. currently I am using angular2 with node js , you can follow same steps for other version of angular.

currently i have structure like this:
    1-Models : it contains files of collection schema [mongoose] 
    2-node_modules : automatically created dependencies lib when you use npm install acc. to package.json
    3-public[not mandatory] : i am using it only for showing favicon icon
    4- routes : it contains routes api 
    5-views : contain only one file index.html [place angular index.html code inside views/index.html ]
    6- app.js : main server file

    	place below two line in app.js
    	app.engine('html',require('ejs').renderFile);  // show that it can run index.html
		app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'client'))); //angular app


Now lets start with angular2
create a folder name 'client'
Now place below 4 files
1-package.json
2-typings.json
3-systemjs.config.js
4-tsconfig.json
you can get abouve files from angular.io website


after then go to terminal
go to client path and write command npm install
after then it will create node_modules there
after then create app folder in same client directory
and below 3 files there:
1- app.module.ts
2-app.component.ts
3-main.ts

and then go to teminal
go to client path and write command: npm run tsc-w
it will create js file of all .ts file

Now go to views/ :
index.html
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css">
 you can place cdn link of bootstrap.css here 

 All is done now:)
 lets run server
 node app.js
